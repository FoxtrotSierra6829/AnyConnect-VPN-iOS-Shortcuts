# AnyConnect-VPN-iOS-Shortcuts

Connect VPN and Disconnect VPN shortcuts for Cisco AnyConnect (iOS)

## Connect VPN

**CAUTION: You need to modify the VPN connection name as well as the password for the shortcut to function.**

The shortcut opens the Cisco AnyConnect App, preselects a connection to be established and copies your password to the clipboard so you can easily paste it. Once a connection has been established (IP adress has changed), the previous app (or if not applicable to the home screen), is returned to.
